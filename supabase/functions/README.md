# Zebrasplit server jobs

Postgres decides who is told what; Edge Functions do the sending. Every
outbound message is first a row in `notification_log`, which is also the
audit trail and the source of the 24-hour nudge cap.

## How the database reaches the functions

`public.notify(user, kind, title, body, data, trip, dedupe)` inserts the log
row, then `private.call_function('push', …)` issues a `net.http_post` (pg_net)
to `https://qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh.supabase.co/functions/v1/<name>` with the
header `x-checkm8-secret`. The secret lives in Supabase Vault under the name
`checkm8_internal_secret` and, with the same value, in the function secret
`CHECKM8_INTERNAL_SECRET`. Rotate both together:

```sql
select vault.update_secret((select id from vault.secrets where name = 'checkm8_internal_secret'), '<new value>');
```
```sh
npx supabase secrets set CHECKM8_INTERNAL_SECRET=<new value> --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh
```

The functions base URL is in `private.config` (`functions_url`); no secrets
are stored in the repo or in `public`.

## Functions

| Function | Trigger | Auth | Secrets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `push` | `public.notify` (pg_net) | shared secret | `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional, only if Expo push security is enabled) |
| `send-invite` | `invites` insert trigger (pg_net), or the app with a user JWT | shared secret, or JWT (only the inviter) | `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM` (all set; `TWILIO_FROM` is Messaging Service `MG017e294d00a0daa9ae26697f5bbb8e26` holding toll-free +1 833 612 7553, which US carriers block until toll-free verification is approved), `INVITE_BASE_URL` (set to the Vercel URL until bunktab.app exists) |
| `reset-otp` | the app, from Forgot password (signed out) | anon key; a one-hour ticket from `request_password_reset_v2` names the account | none (the code goes out through Supabase Auth → Twilio, as at sign-up); optional `INVITE_SMS_DAILY_CAP` is read by `send-invite` (default 500 texts a day) |
| `receipt-parse` | `receipts` insert trigger (pg_net) with `status = 'queued'`, `requeue_receipt()`, or the app with a user JWT | shared secret, or JWT (RLS on the receipts row) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (**needed**), optional `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `RECEIPT_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-5`), `RECEIPT_RETRY_MODEL` (default `claude-opus-5`), `RECEIPT_DAILY_LIMIT` (default 30; the insert trigger reads `private.config.receipt_daily_limit`) |
| `receipt-save` | the app and the web guest view, to save a receipt expense | user JWT; recomputes every share with `_shared/receipt` (a generated copy of `packages/core/src/receipt`, see `scripts/sync-functions.mjs`) and rejects a mismatch, then calls `save_receipt_expense` as the user | none |

`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are
injected by Supabase.

Missing secrets fail soft: `send-invite` logs `{"error":"twilio not
configured","missing":[…]}` on the `invite.sms` row; `receipt-parse` marks the
row `failed` with `error: "not configured"`.

### Notification events (spec table → kind)

| Event | kind | Fired from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invited to a trip | `invite.sms` (text) / `trip.invited` (push with the join link if already a user; they must accept) | `invites` insert trigger, `send-invite` |
| New expense that includes you | `expense.new` | `save_expense` (new rows only) |
| Expense deleted | `expense.deleted` | `delete_expense` |
| Your Done badge was reset | `done.reset` | `reset_done_on_new_expense` trigger (replaces `expense.new` for that person) |
| Nudge | `nudge.inactive` (cron) / `nudge.last_one` (`set_done`) | `run_nudges`, `set_done` (24h cap per member via `trip_members.last_nudged_at`) |
| Close out unlocked | `closeout.unlocked` | `set_done` |
| Owner closed out early | `closeout.override` | `owner_closeout` |
| Removed from a trip | `member.removed` | `remove_member` |
| Payment marked paid | `payment.marked` | `mark_settlement` |
| New comment | `comment.new` | `comments` insert trigger |

## Cron (pg_cron)

| Job | Schedule (UTC) | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bunktab_nudges` | `15 * * * *` | `run_nudges()`: open, started trips with expenses; members not Done and quiet for 24h |
| `bunktab_auto_archive` | `30 9 * * *` | `run_auto_archive()`: open trips quiet for 14 days → `archived` (activity flips them back) |
| `bunktab_invite_expiry` | `45 9 * * *` | `run_invite_expiry()`: pending invites past `expires_at` → `expired` |

Also enforced in the database: 50 invites per user per day
(`guard_invite_rate`), phone numbers normalised to digits.

## Deploy

```sh
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_…            # personal access token, never committed
npx supabase functions deploy push        --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy send-invite --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy reset-otp    --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh
npx supabase functions deploy receipt-parse --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy receipt-save  --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh
npx supabase secrets set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=… TWILIO_FROM=… ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… --project-ref qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh
```

`--no-verify-jwt` is used only where the function checks the shared secret
(or the JWT) itself. Migrations apply with
`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=… node scripts/db-apply.mjs supabase/migrations/<file>.sql`
(Management API; no database password on the build machine).

## Receipt reading

`receipt-parse` reads the photo with the image first and the versioned instructions in
`receipt-parse/prompts/receipt-extraction.v1.md` (cached) second, structured outputs pinned
to `design/receipt/receipt-extraction.schema.json`, validates with Zod, converts to cents and
reconciles (items + item discounts = subtotal ±2¢/line max ±10¢; subtotal + tax + fees −
discounts = total ±1¢). A failed reconciliation retries once on `RECEIPT_RETRY_MODEL`; still
off → `needs_review`. 429/529 retry with backoff ×3, then `failed`. Unreadable → `failed`
with error `unreadable`. The eval harness `scripts/receipt-eval.mjs` runs the same pipeline
against `design/receipt/fixtures/receipts/` (locally with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `--remote`
through the deployed function as a test account) and reports reconciled-pass and
totals-exact rates.

## Test

`npm run smoke:server` (with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` set for the postgres-role
checks) drives the whole path as the two test numbers: Done reset, new
expense, last-one-out, close-out unlocked, comment, delete, payment marked,
invite cap + text attempts, pg_net delivery, push auth, auto-archive and
un-archive, nudge cap, invite expiry. Cleans up after.

## Still needed from you

- **Toll-free verification** for +1 833 612 7553 (Twilio Console → Messaging →
  Regulatory compliance → Toll-free verification): needs a mailing address and
  the app website. Until approved, US carriers drop invite texts.
- **`ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`**, or replace `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with a key
  created inside a workspace.
- Optional: an Expo access token if you turn on push security for the Expo
  project (`EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`).

## Phone login (Supabase Auth)

Login codes go through **Twilio Verify** (service `VAf406e76f8503f527b61d0f38f81e8256`, Supabase `sms_provider = twilio_verify`), which needs no registered number. Test numbers +1 555 555 0100/0101/0102 still take code 123456. Invite texts are separate and use the Messaging Service above.

## Receipt reading key

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. If the key is not scoped to a workspace, also set `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` (Console → Workspaces), or the API answers 400.

## Accounts (mobile)

- **Landing** → Login hub: Continue with Google, Continue with Apple, "or",
  Continue with email or phone (→ password page), and "Text me a code
  instead" for accounts that predate passwords.
- **Sign-up** = name, email, password, phone, Venmo (optional) → "Enter the
  code we just sent you". Under the hood the account is created on
  email + password (`mailer_autoconfirm` is ON because no SMTP provider is
  configured, so the email is trusted without a confirmation mail), then
  `updateUser({ phone })` texts a code through Twilio Verify and
  `verifyOtp(type: "phone_change")` confirms it. The trigger
  `handle_new_auth_user` copies `display_name` / `venmo_username` from the
  sign-up metadata and keeps `users.email`/`users.phone` in step with
  `auth.users`. An account whose phone isn't confirmed is held on the
  add-phone/code step by the app's root layout (that also covers Google and
  Apple accounts, which arrive without a phone).
- Why not phone first: GoTrue refuses `updateUser({ email })` on a
  phone-created account without a mailer ("Email address "" is invalid"),
  so email + password login would never work.
- **Login** = email or phone + password (`signInWithPassword`).
- **Forgot password** = "Email or phone" → Continue. The anon-callable RPC
  `request_password_reset(identifier)` (migration 20260930000001) returns
  the E.164 phone on that account (null for unknown identifiers; this does
  reveal whether an email has an account, as any phone-based reset does) →
  `signInWithOtp({ phone, shouldCreateUser: false })` → the code signs the
  user in → "Reset password" (identifier read-only, new + confirm,
  `updateUser({ password })`) → signed out → login hub with "Password
  updated. Log in with your new password." The same screen serves Profile →
  Change Password as `/(auth)/reset-password?mode=change` (no code, no
  sign-out, back to Profile).
- **Google**: web OAuth through Supabase (`signInWithOAuth`, redirect
  `zebrasplit://callback`; Expo Go uses `exp://…/--/callback`; both allow-listed).
  The Google Cloud OAuth client MUST list
  `https://qywowvkkkxldgxoatdsh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` under
  Authorized redirect URIs, or Google answers `redirect_uri_mismatch`.
- **Apple**: native Sign in with Apple (`expo-apple-authentication`,
  `ios.usesAppleSignIn`), identity token → `signInWithIdToken({ provider:
  "apple", nonce })`. Supabase: `external_apple_enabled` with client id
  `com.bunktab.app` (the bundle id); no Services ID or secret is needed for
  the native path. Requires a native build (not Expo Go); the App ID must
  have the Sign in with Apple capability.
- **Transport retries**: auth requests (`/auth/v1/*`) get one automatic
  retry on a transport failure; data calls never do.
- Auth config set 2026-09-28/30: `password_min_length` 8, `mailer_autoconfirm`
  true, `mailer_secure_email_change_enabled` false, `site_url`
  https://www.zebrasplit.com, redirect allow-list `zebrasplit://**, bunktab://**, exp://**,
  https://www.zebrasplit.com/**`, Apple provider on, Google provider on.

## Settlement rules (2026-10-01, QA round 1)

- `generate_settlements` keeps every payment that is already `marked_paid`
  or `confirmed` exactly as it is. It subtracts those payments from the
  current nets and re-plans only the residual, replacing the `pending` rows.
  The same payer→recipient pair can therefore appear twice (one paid, one
  pending); uniqueness applies to pending rows only.
- A late expense is allowed on a settled trip: `save_expense` reopens it
  (status `open`), the Done badges reset as usual, and close-out re-plans
  once everyone has tapped Done again. `mark_settlement('unmark')` also
  reopens a settled trip.
- Only the expense's creator or the trip owner can delete it. A member can
  only log expenses they paid for; the owner may name another member as the
  payer. Edits by someone else keep the original payer.
- Base-currency amounts are computed server-side from the rate
  (`fx_rate > 0`; forced to 1 when the expense is in the trip's currency);
  client-supplied `base_*` values are ignored. Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, MXN.
- `trips.status`, `settled_at`, `closeout_override_*`, `last_activity_at`
  and `created_by` change only through the RPCs/triggers (they set the
  transaction-local flag `checkm8.internal`); direct updates are refused.

## Password reset (v2)

`request_password_reset_v2(identifier)` returns `{ masked, ticket }` (or null
for an unknown identifier), limited to 5 lookups per identifier per hour;
`reset_phone_for_ticket(ticket)` returns the full E.164 phone once, within an
hour, for the client's `signInWithOtp`. The old `request_password_reset`
now returns the masked number only.

## Media purge

`revenuecat-webhook` (shared secret in the `Authorization` header, deployed
`--no-verify-jwt`) is the only thing that turns a purchase into an owned outfit. The
app asks StoreKit to sell a product; RevenueCat verifies the receipt with Apple or
Google and posts the event here; this calls `grant_purchase()` as the service role,
which writes `user_cosmetics`. The client is never trusted with any of it, so a
tampered build can call every purchase API and still own nothing.

Set `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Supabase secrets and paste the same value into
RevenueCat → Integrations → Webhooks, along with the function URL. RevenueCat retries
for 72 hours and replays receipts on restore and reinstall, so every path is idempotent:
`grant_purchase()` is `on conflict do nothing`, and an unknown product id returns 0
rather than failing, because that means the store sold something this deploy has not
shipped yet and the retry after the next deploy will succeed.

Nothing takes an outfit away. A refund is money back, not stripes back: an item your
friends have already seen on your zebra stays yours, and the refund is Apple's business
with the buyer. `REFUND`, `CANCELLATION` and `EXPIRATION` are logged and answered 200 like
any other event we do not act on. `public.purchases` still records every purchase, so the
decision is reversible: the revoke path is in git history (migration
`20261022000004`) and can come back if the policy ever changes.

`purge-trip-media` (shared secret) is called by the `trips` delete trigger
and removes `covers/<trip>/*` and `receipts/<trip>/*`. `send-invite` refuses
to resend a text within 24 h of a successful send for the same invite.
