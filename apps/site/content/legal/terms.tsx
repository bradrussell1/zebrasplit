    <p>Zebrasplit is a tool for recording shared expenses, calculating who owes whom, and preparing payment requests. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>We aren't a bank, money transmitter or payment processor.</b> We never hold, receive, send or transfer funds.</li>
      <li><b>Payments happen outside the Service.</b> When you tap Pay or Request, we open Venmo (or another payment method) with details filled in. Any payment you make is between you and the other person, through that provider, under its own terms.</li>
      <li><b>Balances depend on what users enter.</b> Calculations, receipt scans, currency conversions and suggested payments are provided for convenience. Review them before you pay. We aren't responsible for errors in the information users add or for amounts you choose to send.</li>
      <li><b>We don't settle disputes between users.</b> If you disagree with someone in your group about who owes what, you'll need to work it out together.</li>
