      <h2 className="t-title2">What we send</h2>
      <p className="t-body">One invitation text when a friend adds you to a trip in Zebrasplit. The message names the friend, the trip, and a link to view it. Login codes are a separate, on-request message: you only receive one when you ask to sign in.</p>

      <h2 className="t-title2">How often</h2>
      <p className="t-body">One message per invitation. There are no recurring messages, reminders or marketing texts from this number. Login codes are sent only when you request them.</p>

      <h2 className="t-title2">How consent is collected</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Invitations are sent by a person you know, from inside the app. On the &quot;Invite the crew&quot; screen the inviter sees a box, unticked by default, that reads:</p>
      <p className="card t-body">&ldquo;{CONSENT}&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="t-body">Zebrasplit sends a text only when the inviter ticks that box. Texting is optional and is never a condition of using Zebrasplit: the trip is created either way, and with the box unticked the inviter is given the invitation link to pass on however they like, and no text is sent. Each invitation text ends with opt-out instructions, and the sending number honours STOP and HELP automatically. Invitations are capped at 50 per person per day.</p>

      <h2 className="t-title2">Sample message</h2>

      <h2 className="t-title2">How to opt out</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message to stop receiving texts from Zebrasplit. Reply <strong>HELP</strong> for help. You can also email <a href="mailto:support@zebrasplit.com">support@zebrasplit.com</a> and we will remove your number.</p>

      <h2 className="t-title2">Rates and delivery</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Message and data rates may apply. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
