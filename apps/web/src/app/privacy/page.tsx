      <p className="t-caption t-muted">Bradley Russell, doing business as Zebrasplit · Effective October 16, 2026 · Updated October 28, 2026 · The full policy lives at <a href="https://zebrasplit.com/privacy">zebrasplit.com/privacy</a>.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">What we collect</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Your phone number (to sign you in and match invites), the display name, optional photo and Venmo, Cash App or PayPal usernames you enter, and the trips, expenses, receipts and comments you and your trip mates create.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">What we don&apos;t collect</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Zebrasplit never touches money. We do not collect bank, card or payment-account details. Payments between trip mates happen in Venmo, Cash App or PayPal under that app&apos;s terms, and in-app purchases are charged by Apple or Google. Your contact list is read on your device only; only the numbers you pick to invite are sent to us.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Purchases</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Outfits for your zebra are bought through the App Store or Google Play. RevenueCat verifies the store receipt and tells us the product, price, time and transaction ID so the outfit can be shown and restored. We never see your card. Refunds go through Apple or Google.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Who can see your data</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Only members of a trip can see that trip. Receipt photos are stored privately and served only to trip members. We do not sell personal data.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">SMS / Text messaging</h2>
      <p className="t-body">We collect your phone number to sign you in and to match trip invitations to you. When a trip member invites friends, the numbers they pick are sent to us and used only to send that one invitation text (see <Link href="/sms">how Zebrasplit texts work</Link>); the inviter must first confirm they have those people&apos;s permission, and being invited never adds you to a trip until you accept. Login codes are sent only when you request them. We do not share phone numbers with third parties for marketing, and we do not send marketing texts. Reply STOP to any message to opt out, or email <a href="mailto:privacy@zebrasplit.com">privacy@zebrasplit.com</a>. Message and data rates may apply.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Your rights</h2>
      <p className="t-body">You can delete your account from inside the app. Deletion removes your personal data and anonymizes your name on shared trips so other members&apos; totals stay correct. California residents may request access to or deletion of their data at any time.</p>
