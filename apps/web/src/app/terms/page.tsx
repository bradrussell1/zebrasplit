      <p className="t-caption t-muted">Bradley Russell, doing business as Zebrasplit · Effective October 16, 2026 · The full policy lives at <a href="https://zebrasplit.com/terms">zebrasplit.com/terms</a>.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">The service</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Zebrasplit helps groups track shared expenses and work out who owes whom. It prepares payments for Venmo but does not send, receive or hold money and cannot see whether a payment completed. Amounts marked paid are self-reported by members.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Your account</h2>
      <p className="t-body">You sign in with your phone number. Keep your device secure; activity under your number is treated as yours. You must be at least 18 or the age of majority where you live.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Acceptable use</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Don&apos;t use Zebrasplit to harass, spam or defraud. Invites are rate-limited. We may suspend accounts that abuse the service.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">Text messages and invitations</h2>
      <p className="t-body">When you add people to a trip, Zebrasplit sends each person who does not already have a Zebrasplit account one text message inviting them to that trip, from our toll-free number. People who already use Zebrasplit get an in-app invitation they can accept or decline instead; they receive no text. By ticking &quot;I agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions&quot; on the invite screen you confirm that you have these people&apos;s permission to have Zebrasplit text them about the trip. One message is sent per invitation; there are no recurring or marketing messages. Recipients can reply STOP at any time to opt out and HELP for help. Message and data rates may apply; carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Full details, the sample message and our contact address are at <Link href="/sms">zebrasplit.com/sms</Link>.</p>
      <h2 className="t-title2">No warranty</h2>
      <p className="t-body">Zebrasplit is provided as is. Check the figures before you pay; we are not liable for payments made in Venmo or elsewhere.</p>
